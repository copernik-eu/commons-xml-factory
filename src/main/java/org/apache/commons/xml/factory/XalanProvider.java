/**
 * Hardening recipes for the external Apache Xalan distribution (the {@code xalan:xalan} artifact).
 *
 * <p>Factory classes live under the {@code org.apache.xalan.*} and {@code org.apache.xpath.*} packages. Xalan ships only TrAX and XPath; its DOM, SAX, StAX and
 * Schema needs are served by whatever JDK or external Xerces is on the classpath.</p>
 *
 * <p>Hardening recipe applied to every factory below uses the same building blocks:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>FSP</strong> ({@link XMLConstants#FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING}, set to {@code true}): enables Xalan's secure-processing mode, which disables
 *         reflection-based extension functions. Required.</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@link DenyAllResolver#URI}</strong>: required. Xalan does not implement the JAXP 1.5 {@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_*} attributes; a deny-all
 *         {@link javax.xml.transform.URIResolver} blocks {@code xsl:include}, {@code xsl:import}, {@code xsl:source-document} during stylesheet compilation
 *         and {@code document()}, {@code unparsed-text()}, {@code collection()} at runtime.</li>
 *     <li><strong>{@link HardeningTransformerFactory} + {@link HardeningTemplates} + {@link HardeningTransformer}</strong>: required. Xalan's source-document
 *         parsing path falls back to {@code SAXParserFactory.newInstance()} whenever the input is not a {@link javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource} or a
 *         {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource} carrying its own {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader}; it only sets FSP on the resulting reader. The wrappers
 *         rewrite every Source through an {@link XmlFactories}-hardened reader so the Xalan internals never get to provision their own.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Caveats</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Replacing the {@code URIResolver} on the factory or transformer cancels the deny-all hardening for XSLT URI fetches; Xalan exposes no
 *         tamper-resistant equivalent of JAXP 1.5 {@code ACCESS_EXTERNAL_STYLESHEET}.</li>
 * </ul>
